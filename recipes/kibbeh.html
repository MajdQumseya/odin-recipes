    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kibbeh is a wonderful dish from the Middle East traditionally made with lamb meat but beef is acceptable, too. I
        prefer it made into patties and fried in olive oil. However, it is most often found in restaurants in baked
        form. Serve kibbeh with tahini, a sesame seed paste.</p>
