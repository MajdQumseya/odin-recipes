    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Za'atar bread is known in the Middle East as mana'eesh. Homemade dough is topped with za'atar, a spice mixture
        composed of sesame seeds, oregano, marjoram, and thyme.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
        <li>6 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons za'atar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Mix in 3 cups flour and salt. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup
            at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place dough in a
            greased bowl; turn to coat with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 16 equal pieces and form into rounds. Roll into 1/4-inch-thick circles. Poke rounds with
            your fingers to create small indentations.</li>
        <li>Mix za'atar and olive oil together in a small bowl. Spread over circles. Place on ungreased baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
